The documentation for bitcoin-python can be found here (or built from sources) :

http://jcsaaddupuy.github.io/dogecoin-python/doc/index.html


Connection to dogecoin-qt
=========================

If you want to connect to dogecoin-qt, add server=1 in your dogecoin.conf
::

 rpcuser=dogecoinrpc
 rpcpassword=A RANDOM GENERATED PASSWORD
 server=1

TODO
======
These things still have to be added:

- SSL support (including certificate verification) for managing remote dogecoin daemons.
